  lastName: string;
  duprRating: number | null;
  position: 1 | 2;
}
```

```typescript
export type TeamSource = 'registration' | 'manual' | 'import';
```

3. **Enhanced Team Interface** (team.ts:19-35)
- Added `source?: TeamSource` field to track team origin
- Added `wins`, `losses`, `pointsFor`, `pointsAgainst`, `matchesPlayed` statistics

### ✅ Task 2: Update TeamCard Component

**File:** [`frontend/src/components/admin/TeamCard.tsx`](frontend/src/components/admin/TeamCard.tsx)

**Key Features Added:**

1. **Player Roster Display**
   - Shows all players with avatar, name, DUPR rating
   - Position badges (P1, P2) for each player
   - Color-coded avatars (primary for P1, secondary for P2)

2. **Source Badge**
   - Green "Registered" badge for teams from registration flow
   - Helps distinguish auto-created teams from manual/import teams

3. **Team Statistics**
   - Displays W-L record
   - Shows Points For - Points Against
   - Shows matches played count

4. **Warning State**
   - Yellow warning box for teams without players
   - Helps identify data integrity issues

**Visual Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Team Name                           │
│ Pool: Pool Name (Seed #1)           │
│ [Registered]                         │
│                                      │
│ ROSTER                               │
│ 👤 FirstName LastName    [P1]       │
│    DUPR: 4.50                        │
│ 👤 FirstName LastName    [P2]       │
│    DUPR: 4.25                        │
│                                      │
│ STATS                                │
│ Record: 5-2 | PF-PA: 150-120         │
│ Matches Played: 7                    │
│                                      │
│ [Edit] [Delete]                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ✅ Task 3: Update RegistrationCard Component

**File:** [`frontend/src/components/admin/registrations/RegistrationCard.tsx`](frontend/src/components/admin/registrations/RegistrationCard.tsx)

**Key Features Added:**

1. **Team Created Status** (Success State)
   - Green "Team Created" chip with checkmark icon
   - "View Team" button with eye icon
   - Navigates to division teams page when clicked

2. **Team Not Created Warning** (Warning State)
   - Yellow "Team Not Created" chip with warning icon
   - Only shown for `has_partner` + `registered` status
   - Helps identify registrations that should have teams

3. **Smart Navigation**
   - Uses `useNavigate` from react-router-dom
   - Routes to: `/tournaments/{tournamentId}/divisions/{divisionId}/teams`
   - Teams page will load with the team visible

**Visual States:**

**With Team:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Player1 LastName + Player2 LastName │
│ DUPR: 4.5 / 4.2 (Avg: 4.35)        │
│                                      │
│ ✅ Team Created  [👁 View Team]     │
│ [Has Partner]                        │
│                                      │
│                              [Delete]│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Without Team (Warning):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Player1 LastName + Player2 LastName │
│ DUPR: 4.5 / 4.2 (Avg: 4.35)        │
│                                      │
│ ⚠️ Team Not Created                 │
│ [Has Partner]                        │
│                                      │
│                              [Delete]│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ✅ Task 4: Update API Hooks

**File:** [`frontend/src/hooks/admin/useRegistrations.ts`](frontend/src/hooks/admin/useRegistrations.ts)

**Changes Made:**

1. **Enhanced `useCreateRegistration`** (lines 18-39)
   - Now invalidates both `registrations` and `admin-teams` query caches
   - Ensures teams list refreshes when new registration creates a team
   - Provides instant feedback in UI

2. **Enhanced `useDeleteRegistration`** (lines 41-57)
   - Invalidates both `registrations` and `admin-teams` query caches
   - Ensures teams list refreshes when registration deletion removes a team
   - Maintains data consistency across views

**Why This Matters:**
- Without cache invalidation, users would need to manually refresh to see team changes
- Auto-created teams appear immediately in the Teams page
- Deleted registrations remove teams immediately from the Teams page

---

## TypeScript Verification

**Command Run:**
```bash
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Result:** ✅ 0 errors

All type definitions are consistent between:
- Backend API response types
- Frontend TypeScript interfaces
- Component prop types
- React Query hooks

---

## Data Flow

### Registration → Team Creation Flow

1. **User Action:** Admin registers a player with partner
   ```
   POST /api/tournaments/:tid/registrations
   { divisionId, playerId, partnerId, pairingType: 'has_partner' }
   ```

2. **Backend Processing:**
   - Creates registration record
   - Auto-creates team with source='registration'
   - Links players via team_players junction table
   - Returns registration with `teamId`

3. **Frontend Updates:**
   - `useCreateRegistration` mutation completes
   - Invalidates `registrations` and `admin-teams` caches
   - React Query refetches both queries
   - RegistrationCard shows "✅ Team Created" badge
   - TeamCard appears in Teams page with player roster

4. **User Experience:**
   - Instant feedback: "Player registered successfully"
   - Team appears in Teams page without manual refresh
   - Can click "View Team" to navigate to division teams

## Manual Testing Checklist

To verify Day 2 implementation works correctly:

### Test 1: View Existing Teams
- [ ] Navigate to division teams page
- [ ] Verify teams show player rosters with avatars
- [ ] Verify DUPR ratings display correctly
- [ ] Verify position badges (P1, P2) appear
- [ ] Verify "Registered" badge appears for registration-source teams
- [ ] Verify team statistics (W-L, PF-PA, Matches) display

### Test 2: View Existing Registrations
- [ ] Navigate to division registrations page
- [ ] Verify registrations with teams show "✅ Team Created" badge
- [ ] Verify "View Team" button appears
- [ ] Click "View Team" - should navigate to teams page
- [ ] Verify registrations without teams show "⚠️ Team Not Created" (only for has_partner)

### Test 3: Create New Registration (Has Partner)
- [ ] Register a new player with partner
- [ ] Verify success toast appears
- [ ] Verify "✅ Team Created" badge appears on registration card
- [ ] Click "View Team" button
- [ ] Verify teams page shows new team with both players

### Test 4: Delete Registration
- [ ] Delete a registration that has a team
- [ ] Verify success toast appears
- [ ] Verify registration disappears from registrations page
- [ ] Navigate to teams page
- [ ] Verify team is deleted (if source='registration')

### Test 5: Edge Cases
- [ ] Register solo player - verify NO team badge appears
- [ ] Register player "needs_partner" - verify NO team badge appears
- [ ] View team without players - verify warning box appears

## Files Changed

| File | Lines Changed | Type |
|------|--------------|------|
| `frontend/src/types/team.ts` | +26 | Types |
| `frontend/src/types/registration.ts` | +1 | Types |
| `frontend/src/components/admin/TeamCard.tsx` | ~200 (rewrite) | Component |

**Total:** ~282 lines changed across 5 files

## Known Limitations

1. **Team Source Filter (Optional - Not Implemented)**
   - Day 2 instructions included optional team source filtering
   - Decided to skip this feature for now
   - Can be added later if needed

2. **No Real-Time Updates**
   - Changes only reflect after query cache invalidation
   - Multi-user concurrent edits may require manual refresh
   - Consider adding WebSocket for real-time sync in future

3. **Navigation Assumption**
   - "View Team" navigates to teams page but doesn't scroll to specific team
   - Future: Add hash/query param to highlight the team

---

## Next Steps (Day 3+)

Based on Day 1 Decision Log, potential future enhancements:

1. **PUT Endpoint for Registration Updates**
   - Allow partner changes without delete + recreate
   - Update team when partner is changed

2. **Duplicate Team Name Handling**
   - Implement auto-suffix logic: "Team Name (2)", "Team Name (3)"
   - Prevent confusion in tournament management

3. **Singles Division Support**
   - Decide: Should solo registrations create 1-player teams?
   - Update team creation logic if yes

4. **Team Source Filtering**
   - Add filter dropdown to Teams page
   - Filter by: All | Registered | Manual | Import

5. **Orphaned Team Cleanup**
   - Add background job to identify orphaned teams
   - Provide UI to review and delete orphaned records

---
