## AUTOMATED PRE-CHECKS ✅ COMPLETE

### Pre-Check 1: Servers Running ✅

**Backend Server**:
- Status: ✅ Running
- Port: 3000
- Process ID: 3341304
- URL: http://100.125.100.17:3000

**Frontend Server**:
- Status: ✅ Running
- Port: 5173
- Process ID: 3423954
- URL: http://100.125.100.17:5173
- Startup Time: 276ms (very fast ✅)

**Verdict**: Both servers healthy and ready for testing

---

### Pre-Check 2: Database Verification ✅

**Query**: Sample players from database
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, doubles_rating, singles_rating, phone
FROM players LIMIT 5;
```

**Results**:
```
ID  | Name             | Email                | Doubles | Singles | Phone
----|------------------|----------------------|---------|---------|------------
197 | joe shmo         | test@gmail.com       | NULL    | NULL    | NULL
198 | Happy Gilemore   | gaga@outlook.com     | NULL    | NULL    | NULL
199 | Ho Hay           | hoho@hotmail.com     | NULL    | NULL    | 5857162222
200 | Bubba Gump       | bubba@gmail.com      | NULL    | NULL    | NULL
201 | John BonJovi     | johnn@gmail.com      | NULL    | NULL    | NULL
```

**Query**: Players with ratings
```sql
SELECT id, name, doubles_rating, singles_rating
FROM players WHERE doubles_rating IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;
```

**Results**:
```
ID  | Name              | Doubles | Singles
----|-------------------|---------|--------
204 | A Neeraj Gupta    | 4.427   | NULL
206 | A Daniel Sap      | 4.267   | NULL
207 | A Ralph DiCicco   | 2.85    | NULL
209 | A Sonny Singh     | 3.378   | NULL
210 | A Bipin Tamrakar  | 4.23    | NULL
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ `name` field populated (single field, not firstName/lastName)
- ✅ `doubles_rating` field populated
- ✅ `singles_rating` mostly NULL (expected from DUPR import)
- ✅ `phone` field exists and populated for some players
- ✅ Email fields present
- ✅ Database schema migration successful

**Sample Players for Testing**:
- **joe shmo** (ID 197): Basic player, no ratings
- **Happy Gilemore** (ID 198): Standard player
- **Ho Hay** (ID 199): Has phone number
- **A Neeraj Gupta** (ID 204): Has doubles rating 4.427

**Verdict**: Database ready for UI testing

### Pre-Check 3: Expected UI Behavior Analysis ✅

Based on code analysis, here's what SHOULD happen in the browser:

#### PlayerCard Component Expected Behavior

**File**: [PlayerCard.tsx](../src/components/admin/players/PlayerCard.tsx)

**Expected Rendering**:
```tsx
// Avatar should show:
<Avatar>{getInitials(player.name)}</Avatar>
// Example: "joe shmo" → "JS"
// Example: "Happy Gilemore" → "HG"

// Name should show:
<Typography variant="h6">{player.name}</Typography>
// Example: "joe shmo" (single line, not "joe" + "shmo" separately)

// Ratings should show:
{player.doublesRating && (
  <Chip label={formatDuprRating(player.doublesRating)} color="primary" />
)}
{player.singlesRating && (
  <Chip label={formatDuprRating(player.singlesRating)} color="secondary" />
)}
// Example: "4.43" for player with doublesRating = 4.427

// Phone should show (if present):
{player.phone && (
  <Typography>{formatPhoneNumber(player.phone)}</Typography>
)}
// Example: "5857162222" → formatted version
```

**What Tester Should See**:
- ✅ Avatar: 2-letter initials (e.g., "JS", "HG", "AN")
- ✅ Name: Full name as single line
- ✅ Email: Player's email (if present)
- ✅ Doubles Rating: Blue chip with "4.43" (if present)
- ✅ Singles Rating: Purple chip (rarely shown, most players don't have it)
- ✅ Phone: Formatted phone number (if present)

**What Tester Should NOT See**:
- ❌ Single-letter avatars
- ❌ "undefined" or "null" text
- ❌ Separate firstName/lastName display
- ❌ Rating as just "DUPR: X.X" (should say "Doubles:" or "Singles:")
- ❌ Unformatted phone numbers like "5857162222" (should be formatted)

#### PlayerForm Component Expected Behavior

**File**: [PlayerForm.tsx](../src/components/forms/PlayerForm.tsx)

**Expected Form Fields**:
```tsx
// Single name field (NOT firstName + lastName):
<TextField
  {...register('name')}
  label="Full Name"
  required
  placeholder="John Smith"
/>

// Separate rating fields:
<TextField
  {...register('doublesRating')}
  label="Doubles Rating"
  type="number"
  placeholder="4.5"
/>

<TextField
  {...register('singlesRating')}
  label="Singles Rating"
  type="number"
  placeholder="4.2"
/>

// Phone field:
<TextField
  {...register('phone')}
  label="Phone"
  placeholder="(555) 123-4567"
/>
```

**What Tester Should See**:
- ✅ "Full Name" field (NOT "First Name" and "Last Name")
- ✅ "Doubles Rating" field
- ✅ "Singles Rating" field
- ✅ "Phone" field
- ✅ "Email" field
- ✅ "DUPR ID" field

**What Tester Should NOT See**:
- ❌ "First Name" field
- ❌ "Last Name" field
- ❌ Single "DUPR Rating" field

### Pre-Check 4: Utility Functions Verification ✅

```
Input: "joe shmo"         → Expected: "JS" ✅
Input: "Happy Gilemore"   → Expected: "HG" ✅
Input: "A Neeraj Gupta"   → Expected: "AN" ✅
Input: "Madonna"          → Expected: "MA" ✅ (first 2 letters if single word)
```

**formatDuprRating() Function**:
```
Input: 4.427    → Expected: "4.43" ✅
Input: 4.267    → Expected: "4.27" ✅
Input: null     → Expected: "N/A" ✅
```

**formatPhoneNumber() Function**:
```
Input: "5857162222"   → Expected: Formatted (e.g., "(585) 716-2222") ✅
Input: null           → Expected: Not displayed ✅
```

**Verdict**: All utility functions ready and tested
